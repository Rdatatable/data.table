This is the list of follow up issues that may be resolved after all rolling functions PRs will be merged. As of the current moment none of those is a bug fix or essentially necessary but rather good practice changes.

- use `test(..., options(datatable.verbose=TRUE))` rather than `options(datatable.verbose=TRUE)`

- verbose output `frolladaptivefun: algo 0 not implemented, fall back to 1` could be more intuitive

The only reason why it was added was that we can test if expected algo is being used. Rolling functions do not expose verbose arg directly, it has to be set via options, therefore full user friendliness is maybe not the biggest priority at the moment. We will also have to keep in mind buffer limit of 500 characters set for `snprintf`.

- The `snprintf(end(message), 500, format, ...)` idiom should be more like `len = strlen(ans->message[0]); snprintf(ans->message[0] + len, sizeof(ans->message[0]) - len, format, ...)`, but I don't see a way the current code could overflow the 4096-byte buffer, even with long translation strings; the current code doesn't cause a problem.
