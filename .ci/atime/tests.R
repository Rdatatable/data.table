# A list of performance tests.
#
# See documentation in https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/wiki/Performance-testing for best practices.
#
# Each entry in this list corresponds to a performance test and contains a sublist with three mandatory arguments:
# - N: A numeric sequence of data sizes to vary.
# - setup: An expression evaluated for every data size before measuring time/memory.
# - expr: An expression that will be evaluated for benchmarking performance across different git commit versions.
#         This must call a function from data.table using a syntax with double or triple colon prefix.
#         The package name before the colons will be replaced by a new package name that uses the commit SHA hash.
#         (For instance, data.table:::[.data.table will become data.table.some_40_digit_SHA1_hash:::[.data.table)
#
# Optional parameters that may be useful to configure tests:
# - times: Number of times each expression is evaluated (default is 10).
# - seconds.limit: The maximum median timing (in seconds) of an expression. No timings for larger N are computed past that threshold. Default of 0.01 seconds should be sufficient for most tests.
# - Historical references (short version name = commit SHA1).
#   For historical regressions, use version names 'Before', 'Regression', and 'Fixed'
#   When there was no regression, use 'Slow' and 'Fast' 
# @note Please check https://github.com/tdhock/atime/blob/main/vignettes/data.table.Rmd for more information.
# nolint start: undesirable_operator_linter. ':::' needed+appropriate here.

  # A function to customize R package metadata and source files to facilitate version-specific installation and testing.
  #
  # This is specifically tailored for handling data.table which requires specific changes in non-standard files (such as the object file name in Makevars and version checking code in onLoad.R)
  # to support testing across different versions (base and HEAD for PRs, commits associated with historical regressions, etc.) of the package.
  # It appends a SHA1 hash to the package name (PKG.SHA), ensuring each version can be installed and tested separately.
  #
  # @param old.Package Current name of the package.
  # @param new.Package New name of the package, including a SHA hash.
  # @param sha SHA1 hash used for differentiating versions.
  # @param new.pkg.path Path to the package files.
  #
  # @details
  # The function modifies:
  # - DESCRIPTION, updating the package name.
  # - Makevars, customizing the shared object file name and adjusting the build settings.
  # - R/onLoad.R, adapting custom version checking for package loading operations.
  # - NAMESPACE, changing namespace settings for dynamic linking.
  #
  # @examples
  # pkg.edit.fun("data.table", "data.table.some_SHA1_hash", "some_SHA1_hash", "/path/to/data.table")
  #
  # @return None (performs in-place file modifications)
  # @note This setup is typically unnecessary for most packages but essential for data.table due to its unique configuration.
