\title{Fast row reordering of a data.table by reference}
\description{
In \code{data.table} parlance, all \code{set*} functions change their input
\emph{by reference}. That is, no copy is made at all, other than temporary
working memory, which is as large as one column. The only other
\code{data.table} operator that modifies input by reference is \code{\link{:=}}.
Check out the \code{See Also} section below for other \code{set*} function
\code{data.table} provides.

\code{setorder} (and \code{setorderv}) reorders the rows of a \code{data.table}
based on the columns (and column order) provided. It reorders the table
\emph{by reference} and is therefore very memory efficient.

Also \code{x[order(.)]} is now optimised internally to use data.table's fast
order. data.table always reorders in "C-locale" (see Details). To sort by session
locale, use \code{x[base::order(.)]}.

\code{bit64::integer64} type is also supported for reordering rows of a
\code{data.table}.

\usage{
setorder(x, \dots, na.last=FALSE)
setorderv(x, cols, order=1L, na.last=FALSE)
# optimised to use data.table's internal fast order
# x[order(., na.last=TRUE)]
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{ A \code{data.table}. }
\item{\dots}{ The columns to sort by. Do not quote column names. If \code{\dots}
is missing (ex: \code{setorder(x)}), \code{x} is rearranged based on all
columns in ascending order by default. To sort by a column in descending order
prefix a \code{"-"}, i.e., \code{setorder(x, a, -b, c)}. The \code{-b} works
when \code{b} is of type \code{character} as well. }
\item{cols}{ A character vector of column names of \code{x}, to which to order
by. Do not add \code{"-"} here. Use \code{order} argument instead.}
\item{order}{ An integer vector with only possible values of \code{1} and
\code{-1}, corresponding to ascending and descending order. The length of
\code{order} must be either \code{1} or equal to that of \code{cols}. If
\code{length(order) == 1}, it is recycled to \code{length(cols)}. }
\item{na.last}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, missing values in the data are placed
last; if \code{FALSE}, they are placed first; if \code{NA} they are removed.
\code{na.last=NA} is valid only for \code{x[order(., na.last)]} and its
default is \code{TRUE}. \code{setorder} and \code{setorderv} only accept
TRUE/FALSE with default \code{FALSE}.}
}
\details{
\code{data.table} implements fast radix based ordering. In versions <= 1.9.2,
it was only capable of increasing order (ascending). From 1.9.4 on, the
functionality has been extended to decreasing order (descending) as well.

\code{setorder} accepts unquoted column names (with names preceded with a
\code{-} sign for descending order) and reorders data.table rows
\emph{by reference}, for e.g., \code{setorder(x, a, -b, c)}. Note that
\code{-b} also works with columns of type \code{character} unlike
\code{base::order}, which requires \code{-xtfrm(y)} instead (which is slow).
\code{setorderv} in turn accepts a  character vector of column names and an
integer vector of column order separately.

Note that \code{\link{setkey}} still requires and will always sort only in
ascending order, and is different from \code{setorder} in that it additionally
sets the \code{sorted} attribute.

\code{na.last} argument, by default, is \code{FALSE} for \code{setorder} and
\code{setorderv} to be consistent with \code{data.table}'s \code{setkey} and
is \code{TRUE} for \code{x[order(.)]} to be consistent with \code{base::order}.
Only \code{x[order(.)]} can have \code{na.last = NA} as it is a subset operation
as opposed to \code{setorder} or \code{setorderv} which reorders the data.table
by reference.

\code{data.table} always reorders in "C-locale".
As a consequence, the ordering may be different to that obtained by \code{base::order}.
In English locales, for example, sorting is case-sensitive in C-locale.
Thus, sorting \code{c("c", "a", "B")} returns \code{c("B", "a", "c")} in \code{data.table}
 but \code{c("a", "B", "c")} in \code{base::order}. Note this makes no difference in most cases
of data; both return identical results on ids where only upper-case or lower-case letters are present (\code{"AB123" < "AC234"}
is true in both), or on country names and other proper nouns which are consistently capitalized.
For example, neither \code{"America" < "Brazil"} nor
\code{"america" < "brazil"} are affected since the first letter is consistently
capitalized.

Using C-locale makes the behaviour of sorting in \code{data.table} more consistent across sessions and locales.
The behaviour of \code{base::order} depends on assumptions about the locale of the R session.
In English locales, \code{"america" < "BRAZIL"} is true by default
but false if you either type \code{Sys.setlocale(locale="C")} or the R session has been started in a C locale
for you -- which can happen on servers/services since the locale comes from the environment the R session
was started in. By contrast, \code{"america" < "BRAZIL"} is always false in \code{data.table} regardless of the way your R session was started.

If \code{setorder} results in reordering of the rows of a keyed \code{data.table},
then its key will be set to \code{NULL}.
}
\value{
The input is modified by reference, and returned (invisibly) so it can be used
in compound statements; e.g., \code{setorder(DT,a,-b)[, cumsum(c), by=list(a,b)]}.
If you require a copy, take a copy first (using \code{DT2 = copy(DT)}). See
\code{?copy}.
