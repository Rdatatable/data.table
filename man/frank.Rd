\title{Fast rank}
\description{
  Similar to \code{base::rank} but \emph{much faster}. And it accepts vectors, lists, data.frames or data.tables as input. In addition to the \code{ties.method} possibilities provided by \code{base::rank}, it also provides \code{ties.method="dense"}.

  \code{bit64::integer64} type is also supported.
}

\usage{
frank(x, ..., na.last=TRUE, ties.method=c("average",
  "first", "random", "max", "min", "dense"))

frankv(x, cols=seq_along(x), order=1L, na.last=TRUE,
      ties.method=c("average", "first", "random",
        "max", "min", "dense"))

}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{ A vector, or list with all it's elements identical in length or data.frame or data.table. }
  \item{...}{ Only for lists, data.frames and data.tables. The columns to calculate ranks based on. Do not quote column names. If ... is missing, all columns are considered by default. To sort by a column in descending order prefix a "-", e.g., frank(x, a, -b, c). The -b works when b is of type character as well.}
  \item{cols}{ A character vector of column names (or numbers) of x, to which obtain ranks for. }
  \item{order}{ An integer vector with only possible values of 1 and -1, corresponding to ascending and descending order. The length of order must be either 1 or equal to that of cols. If length(order) == 1, it's recycled to length(cols). }
  \item{na.last}{ Control treatment of \code{NA}s. If \code{TRUE}, missing values in the data are put last; if \code{FALSE}, they are put first; if \code{NA}, they are removed; if \code{"keep"} they are kept with rank \code{NA}. }
  \item{ties.method}{ A character string specifying how ties are treated, see \code{Details}. }
}
\details{
  To be consistent with other \code{data.table} operations, \code{NA}s are considered identical to other \code{NA}s (and \code{NaN}s to other \code{NaN}s), unlike \code{base::rank}. Therefore, for \code{na.last=TRUE} and \code{na.last=FALSE}, \code{NA}s (and \code{NaN}s) are given identical ranks, unlike \code{\link[base]{rank}}.

  \code{frank} is not limited to vectors. It accepts data.tables (and lists and data.frames) as well. It accepts unquoted column names (with names preceded with a \code{-} sign for descending order, even on character vectors), for e.g., \code{frank(DT, a, -b, c, ties.method="first")} where \code{a,b,c} are columns in \code{DT}. The equivalent in \code{frankv} is the \code{order} argument.

  In addition to the \code{ties.method} values possible using base's \code{\link[base]{rank}}, it also provides another additional argument \emph{"dense"} which returns the ranks without any gaps in the ranking. See examples.
}
\value{
  A numeric vector of length equal to \code{NROW(x)} (unless \code{na.last = NA}, when missing values are removed). The vector is of integer type unless \code{ties.method = "average"} when it is of double type (irrespective of ties).
}

\examples{
# on vectors
x = c(4, 1, 4, NA, 1, NA, 4)
# NAs are considered identical (unlike base R)
# default is average
frankv(x) # na.last=TRUE
frankv(x, na.last=FALSE)

# ties.method = min
frankv(x, ties.method="min")
# ties.method = dense
frankv(x, ties.method="dense")

# on data.table
DT = data.table(x, y=c(1, 1, 1, 0, NA, 0, 2))
frankv(DT, cols="x") # same as frankv(x) from before
frankv(DT, cols="x", na.last="keep")
frankv(DT, cols="x", ties.method="dense", na.last=NA)
frank(DT, x, ties.method="dense", na.last=NA) # equivalent of above using frank
# on both columns
frankv(DT, ties.method="first", na.last="keep")
frank(DT, ties.method="first", na.last="keep") # equivalent of above using frank

# order argument
frank(DT, x, -y, ties.method="first")
# equivalent of above using frankv
frankv(DT, order=c(1L, -1L), ties.method="first")
