\title{Fast dcast for data.table}
\description{
  \code{dcast.data.table} is \code{data.table}'s long-to-wide reshaping tool. In the spirit of \code{data.table}, it is very fast and memory efficient, making it well-suited to handling large data sets in RAM.  More importantly, it is capable of handling very large data quite efficiently in terms of memory usage. \code{dcast.data.table} can also cast multiple \code{value.var} columns and accepts multiple functions to \code{fun.aggregate}. See Examples for more.

\usage{
\method{dcast}{data.table}(data, formula, fun.aggregate = NULL, sep = "_",
    \dots, margins = NULL, subset = NULL, fill = NULL,
    drop = TRUE, value.var = guess(data),
    verbose = getOption("datatable.verbose"))
}
\arguments{
  \item{data}{ A \code{data.table}.}
  \item{formula}{A formula of the form LHS ~ RHS to cast, see Details.}
  \item{fun.aggregate}{Should the data be aggregated before casting? If the formula doesn't identify a single observation for each cell, then aggregation defaults to \code{length} with a message.

  To use multiple aggregation functions, pass a \code{list}; see Examples. }
  \item{sep}{Character vector of length 1, indicating the separating character in variable names generated during casting. Default is \code{_} for backwards compatibility. }
  \item{\dots}{Any other arguments that may be passed to the aggregating function.}
  \item{margins}{Not implemented yet. Should take variable names to compute margins on. A value of \code{TRUE} would compute all margins.}
  \item{subset}{Specified if casting should be done on a subset of the data. Ex: \code{subset = .(col1 <= 5)} or \code{subset = .(variable != "January")}.}
  \item{fill}{Value with which to fill missing cells. If \code{fun.aggregate} is present, takes the value by applying the function on a 0-length vector.}
  \item{drop}{\code{FALSE} will cast by including all missing combinations.

  \code{c(FALSE, TRUE)} will only include all missing combinations of formula \code{LHS}; \code{c(TRUE, FALSE)} will only include all missing combinations of formula RHS. See Examples.}

  \item{value.var}{Name of the column whose values will be filled to cast. Function \code{guess()} tries to, well, guess this column automatically, if none is provided.

  Cast multiple \code{value.var} columns simultaneously by passing their names as a \code{character} vector. See Examples. }
  \item{verbose}{Not used yet. May be dropped in the future or used to provide informative messages through the console.}
}
\details{
The cast formula takes the form \code{LHS ~ RHS}, ex: \code{var1 + var2 ~ var3}. The order of entries in the formula is essential. There are two special variables: \code{.} represents no variable, while \code{\dots} represents all variables not otherwise mentioned in \code{formula}; see Examples.

When not all combinations of LHS & RHS values are present in the data, some or all (in accordance with \code{drop}) missing combinations will replaced with the value specified by \code{fill}. Note that \code{fill} will be converted to the class of \code{value.var}; see Examples.

\code{dcast} also allows \code{value.var} columns of type \code{list}.

When variable combinations in \code{formula} don't identify a unique value, \code{fun.aggregate} will have to be specified, which defaults to \code{length}. For the formula \code{var1 ~ var2}, this means there are some \code{(var1, var2)} combinations in the data corresponding to multiple rows (i.e. \code{x} is not unique by \code{(var1, var2)}.

The aggregating function should take a vector as input and return a single value (or a list of length one) as output. In cases where \code{value.var} is a list, the function should be able to handle a list input and provide a single value or list of length one as output.

If the formula's LHS contains the same column more than once, ex: \code{dcast(DT, x+x~ y)}, then the answer will have duplicate names. In those cases, the duplicate names are renamed using \code{make.unique} so that key can be set without issues.

Names for columns that are being cast are generated in the same order (separated by an underscore, \code{_}) from the (unique) values in each column mentioned in the formula RHS.

From \code{v1.9.4}, \code{dcast} tries to preserve attributes wherever possible.

From \code{v1.9.6}, it is possible to cast multiple \code{value.var} columns and also cast by providing multiple \code{fun.aggregate} functions. Multiple \code{fun.aggregate} functions should be provided as a \code{list}, for e.g., \code{list(mean, sum, function(x) paste(x, collapse="")}. \code{value.var} can be either a character vector or list of length one, or a list of length equal to \code{length(fun.aggregate)}. When \code{value.var} is a character vector or a list of length one, each function mentioned under \code{fun.aggregate} is applied to every column specified under \code{value.var} column. When \code{value.var} is a list of length equal to \code{length(fun.aggregate)} each element of \code{fun.aggregate} is applied to each element of \code{value.var} column.

Historical note: \code{dcast.data.table} was originally designed as an enhancement to \code{reshape2::dcast} in terms of computing and memory efficiency. \code{reshape2} has since been superseded in favour of \code{tidyr}, and \code{dcast} has had a generic defined within \code{data.table} since \code{v1.9.6} in 2015, at which point the dependency between the packages became more etymological than programmatic. We thank the \code{reshape2} authors for the inspiration.
