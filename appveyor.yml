# R_CHECK_ARGS specified in order to turn off --as-cran (default) as that can be slow, and
# -no-multiarch so that 32bit tests run separately, otherwise both 32bit and 64bit tests run in one job.
# Separating the jobs out so we can very easily see in AppVeyor status which one(s) failed. It speeds
# up dev cycle if the first one returns quickly since once passing locally on Linux, we push to test on Windows.
