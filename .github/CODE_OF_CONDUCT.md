As contributors and maintainers of this project, and in the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.

We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery
* Personal attacks
* Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing other's private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission

Project members with the Committer role have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

By adopting this Code of Conduct, project members commit themselves to fairly and consistently apply these principles to every aspect of managing this project. Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct may be permanently removed from the project team.

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.


## Reporting

Project members with the Committer role or the CRAN Maintainer role are pledged to promptly address any reported issues. Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to any individual with this role.

Those who prefer to report in a way that is independent of the current Committers and Maintainer may instead contact the Community Engagement Coordinator by e-mailing [r.data.table\@gmail.com](mailto:r.data.table@gmail.com). Messages sent to this e-mail address will be visible only to the current Community Engagement Coordinator, a position always held by an individual who is not a Committer or CRAN Maintainer of the package.

The current Committers are Toby Dylan Hocking (@tdhock), Matt Dowle (@mattdowle), Arun Srinivasan (@arunsrinivasan), Jan Gorecki (@jangorecki), Michael Chirico (@MichaelChirico), and Benjamin Schwendinger (@ben-schwen).

The current CRAN Maintainer is Tyson Barrett (@tysonstanley).

The current Community Engagement Coordinator is Kelly Bodwin (@kbodwin).

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Complaint respondents are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
