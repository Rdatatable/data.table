Click preview tab ^^^ above!

By continuing to file this new issue / feature request, I confirm I have :
1. searched the [live NEWS file](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/blob/master/NEWS.md) to see if it has been fixed in dev already. If so, I tried the [latest dev version](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/wiki/Installation#windows).
2. looked at the titles of all the issues in the [current milestones](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/milestones) and am aware of those. (Adding new information to existing issues is very helpful and appreciated.)
3. [searched all issues](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues) (i.e. not in a milestone yet) for similar issues to mine and will include links to them explaining why mine is different.
4. searched on [Stack Overflow's data.table tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/data.table) and there is nothing similar there.
5. read the [Support](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/wiki/Support) and [Contributing](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) guides.
6. please don't tag your issue with text in the title; project members will add the appropriate tags later.
