 * if requested by the user, or mark some columns as skipped.
 *
 * @param types
 *    type codes of each column in the CSV file. Possible type codes are
 *    described by the `colType` enum. The function may modify this array
 *    setting some types to 0 (CT_DROP), or upcasting the types. Downcasting is
 *    not allowed and will trigger an error from `freadMain` later on.
 *
 * @param colNames
 *    array of `lenOff` structures (offsets are relative to the `anchor`)
 *    describing the column names. If the CSV file had no header row, then this
 *    array will be filled with 0s.
 *
 * @param anchor
 *    pointer to a string buffer (usually somewhere inside the memory-mapped
 *    file) within which the column names are located, as described by the
 *    `colNames` array.
