# WRE states ($1.6) that += isn't portable and that we aren't allowed to use it.
# Otherwise we could use the much simpler PKG_LIBS += @openmp_cflags@ -lz.
# Can't do PKG_LIBS = $(PKG_LIBS)...  either because that's a 'recursive variable reference' error in make
# Hence the onerous @...@ substitution. Is it still appropriate in 2020 that we can't use +=?
# Note that -lz is now escaped via @zlib_libs@ when zlib is not installed
