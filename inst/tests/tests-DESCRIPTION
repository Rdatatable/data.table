Title: List of data.table dependencies used in integration tests
Authors@R: c(person("data.table team", role = c("aut", "cre", "cph"), email="mattjdowle@gmail.com"))
Description: Standalone R DESCRIPTION file which defines R dependencies for integration tests of data.table package. Integration tests are not part of main testing workflow. They are performed only when TEST_DATA_TABLE_WITH_OTHER_PACKAGES environment variable is set to true. This allows us to run those integration tests in our CI pipeline and not impose dependency chains on the user.
Suggests: ggplot2 (>= 0.9.0), reshape, hexbin, fastmatch, nlme, gdata, caret, plm, rmarkdown, parallel
